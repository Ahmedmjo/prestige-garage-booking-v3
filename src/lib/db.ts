 * Cache-busting version key for the shared PrismaClient singleton.
 *
 * Next.js dev (Turbopack) keeps `globalThis` alive across HMR reloads, so a
 * naive `globalThis.prisma ?? new PrismaClient()` will keep reusing a client
 * that was constructed from a *previously* generated `@prisma/client` — even
 * after `prisma generate` regenerates the engine for a different datasource
 * provider (e.g. postgresql → sqlite).
 *
 * By keying the singleton with a version string, we can force a fresh
 * `PrismaClient` to be constructed whenever the schema/engine changes: just
 * bump `PRISMA_CLIENT_VERSION` and HMR will recreate the client in place.
